# Tasks
* File drawer (force my way through bootstap) instead of file selector
* Fix the `eslint` warnings that appear on `npm run build`
* I think I should just populate the store with everything (filenames and contents) and then read everything from there instead of using both store and `localStorage`. This will make migrating to using an API or something easier.
* Next untitled does not work if there is only `Untitled`
